# Hide Active Now (for Discord, duh)

Hey! I have a question for you. Do you like the "Active Now" tab on Discord? If your answer is yes, I don't really know what are you doing here. But if your answer is no, you're in the right place! This theme removes/hides the "Active Now" tab (on Discord, obviously). For now, I'll refer to the plugin as HAND (Hide Active Now for Discord).

I know HAND may be kinda "useless" and it's just basic CSS, but I hope it helps you out.

## How to install HAND?

 - Step 1: Download the HAND theme file and move it to the [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) themes folder.
 - Step 2: Enable the theme on BetterDiscord.
 - Step 3: That's it. Yeah, that's it, there's nothing more than that. It's just a theme. Nothing more than that.
